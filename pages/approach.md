<h3>Our technology is a cutting edge bispecific antibody designed to</h3>
<ul>
<li> Be directly administered to patients through injection, ensuring a precise and controlled delivery.</li>
<li>Accurately target and bind to a specific component of the human innate immune complex (HIIC), a natural part of the body's defense mechanism, circulating within the bloodstream.</li>
<li>Navigate this bound immune complex towards cancer cells, utilizing the ability to recognize and attach to specific markers present only on the surface of these cells.</li>
<li>Significantly increase the concentration of the HIIC within cancer cells, triggering a focused and effective destruction of the malignant cells.</li>
</ul>
