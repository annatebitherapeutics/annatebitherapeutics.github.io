At Annate Bitherapeutics, we’re pioneering a new class of ApoL1-based therapeutics designed to tackle some of the hardest-to-treat cancers. By harnessing ApoL1’s unique biology, we’re creating precision therapies that act through a completely new mechanism—offering the potential for safer, more effective treatment options.

Our lead programs target multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer, two diseases that remain among the most challenging in oncology. Backed by strong science and a clear clinical path, Annate is building a pipeline that redefines how cancer can be treated. We’re driven by a simple goal: to turn breakthrough biology into transformative medicines for patients who need them most.
