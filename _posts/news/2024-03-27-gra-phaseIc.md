The continued investment by GRA reflects confidence in the promising trajectory of the research conducted thus far. Phase Ic funding will enable the team to rigorously test their lead compound in vivo, providing vital data on efficacy and safety that are essential for progression to clinical trials.

Dr. Stephen Hajduk, leading the charge at the Hajduk Lab, comments on the progress: "The journey from early research to proof-of-concept studies is a testament to our team's dedication and GRA's support. These animal studies are a pivotal phase in our research, bringing us one step closer to a potential new treatment for Multiple Myeloma patients. We are incredibly grateful for the opportunity to translate our findings from the lab bench to preclinical models."

The successful completion of this phase is anticipated to pave the way for subsequent phases of development and further establish the research's potential to alter the course of treatment for Multiple Myeloma, reaffirming GRA's investment in transformative healthcare solutions.
