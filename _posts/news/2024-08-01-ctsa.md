The Lesinski and Hajduk labs are proud to announce they have been awarded $50,000 from the Georgia Clinical & Translational Science Alliance (Georgia CTSA) to advance their groundbreaking work harnessing the human immune protein Apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) to selectively eliminate cancer cells. By developing bispecific antibodies (bsAb) that bind ApoL1 and cancer-specific targets such as BCMA or mesothelin, this research offers a promising new strategy against multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancers.

This project addresses key hurdles in translating complex antibody-based treatments into clinical practice. By developing physiologically relevant models, the Lesinski and Hajduk labs aim to accelerate the development of a potent, precise treatment option for patients with mesothelin-expressing cancers. Their collaboration, supported by the Georgia CTSA, underscores the pivotal role of innovative research and cross-institutional funding in driving progress toward next-generation cancer therapies.
