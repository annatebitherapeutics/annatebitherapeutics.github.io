    Annate Biotherapeutics was named in honor of Ann Hajduk, whose life was cut short by multiple myeloma. Ann was the beloved wife of one of our founders, and her journey with cancer continues to inspire our mission every day.


    Her story is at the heart of Annate. It reminds us that behind every data point and every clinical milestone is a patient and a family waiting for hope. Ann’s courage and resilience drive us to push beyond the boundaries of existing therapies, to build treatments that not only extend life but improve its quality.


    At Annate, we carry Ann’s legacy forward by transforming innovation into impact. Our work on ApoL1-based therapeutics is more than a scientific endeavor — it is a promise to honor Ann’s memory and to fight for the countless patients who, like her, face devastating cancers with too few options.


    Ann’s legacy fuels our commitment: to bring forward new therapies with urgency, compassion, and unwavering dedication to patients.
