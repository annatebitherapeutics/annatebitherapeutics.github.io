  short_description: "Pioneering precise, accessible cancer therapies for a hopeful future."
  description: >
    The goal of Annate Bitherapeutics is to develop an entirely new approach to cancer treatment by redirecting an arm of the human innate immune system from that of killing invading pathogens to the highly specific targeting and elimination of human cancers. 
    Our approach circumvents the need for toxic drugs, stem-cell transplants, or activation of T-cell dependent pathways.

    
    We are currently developing our technology to target both solid and liquid tumors and strong preliminary findings suggest little to no off-target toxicity, thanks in part to the unique use of a naturally occurring immune component and the repurposing of a delivery mechanism which is already FDA-approved.
