  disease_overview:
    title: "Multiple Myeloma Disease Landscape"
    content: |
      Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder that accounts for ~10% of hematologic cancers and ~2% of all cancers. The American Cancer Society estimates ~36,110 new U.S. diagnoses and ~12,030 deaths in 2025—highlighting substantial unmet need despite progress with proteasome inhibitors, IMiDs, anti-CD38 mAbs, and BCMA-directed therapies.

      Patients typically experience cycles of remission and relapse, cumulative toxicity, and end-organ damage (bone, renal). Outcomes are especially poor in triple-class-refractory disease, where survival can be measured in months. Differentiated, off-the-shelf mechanisms that do not depend on T-cell fitness remain a priority for later-line care.

    title: "BCMA as a Precision Anchor"
    content: |
      BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) is found on mature B cells and plasma cells, where it promotes survival signals that myeloma cells exploit.

       While BCMA-directed CAR-T and bispecific therapies have proven the target’s value, they face challenges like T-cell exhaustion and limited accessibility. ANN-01M offers an immune-independent approach that preserves BCMA as a target while reducing systemic toxicity and simplifying development.

    content: |
      **Mechanism & Rationale**

      - ANN-01M bispecific escorts endogenous ApoL1 into BCMA+ myeloma cells; post-internalization lysosomal pore formation delivers immune-cell–independent killing.
      - Designed as an off-the-shelf, redosable option suitable for heavily pre-treated, immunosuppressed patients.

      **Current Progress (pre-clinical)**

      - In-vitro: BCMA-dependent binding, rapid internalization, ApoL1-redirected killing in BCMA+ lines; no activity in BCMA-negative controls.
      - Selectivity & Safety: Early off-target screens;

      **Translational Models (in flight / planned)**

      - Emory/Winship access to myeloma PDX and primary samples for benchmark comparisons.
      - Transgenic Human ApoL1-capable NSG mouse models to assess efficacy and safety in a relevant background.
      - γ-secretase inhibitor in-vivo studies to evaluate mBCMA vs sBCMA effects on exposure and response.

      **Regulatory Workstreams**

      - Focused on MoA validation, early tox signals, expanded animal model choices - gates supporting an INTERACT → pre-IND path.
      - CMC readiness: sequence/format lock, pilot expression, developability & stability screens, and CDMO down-selection for GLP tox material; business development for future GMP capacity.

      **Near-Term Milestones**

      - Complete expanded in-vitro panel and BCMA threshold analysis; initiate PDX efficacy.
      - Finalize tox strategy in humanized/NSG models; progress IND-enabling study design.
      - Deliver CMC feasibility package (titre/yield, HCP/HC DNA analytics, stability screens).

  disease_overview:
    title: "Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Landscape"
    content: |
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for >90% of pancreatic cancers and is on track to become the #2 cause of U.S. cancer death by 2030. The American Cancer Society estimates ~67,440 new U.S. cases and ~51,980 deaths in 2025, reflecting late presentation and limited screening options.

      Most patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease. Despite intensive regimens (FOLFIRINOX; gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel), median overall survival in advanced PDAC is typically <12 months. Dense desmoplastic stroma, immune exclusion, and early micrometastatic spread demand off-the-shelf mechanisms that do not rely on patient T-cell fitness and can function within a hostile tumor microenvironment.

    - label: "Global burden"
      detail: "GLOBOCAN 2022: ~511,000 new cases; ~467,000 deaths worldwide; high incidence/mortality in Europe & North America."
    - label: "Five-year survival (all stages)"
      detail: "~13% overall; stage-dependent (localized 44%, regional 16%, distant 3%) (SEER/ACS 2014-2020 cohort)."

  target_profile:
    title: "Mesothelin Biology & Relevance"
    content: |
      Mesothelin (MSLN) is a surface protein found at very low levels in healthy tissues but highly expressed in most pancreatic cancers (around 80-90%). It binds to MUC16/CA125, helping cancer cells stick and spread. Because it's common in tumors and rare in vital tissues, MSLN serves as both a useful biomarker and an effective target for drug delivery.

      ANN-01P leverages MSLN internalization to ferry endogenous ApoL1 into tumor lysosomes, aiming for immune-cell-independent kill while avoiding systemic payload toxicities and manufacturing constraints typical of cell therapies.

  development_strategy:
    title: "ANN-01P Program & Research Plan"
    content: |
      **Mechanism & Rationale**

      - ANN-01P bispecific architecture captures circulating ApoL1 and traffics it into mesothelin-positive PDAC cells, triggering lysosomal pore formation and tumor cell lysis independent of T cells or Fc-effector reliance.

      **Current Progress (pre-clinical)**

      - In-vitro: Specific binding to MSLN+ PDAC lines, internalization, ApoL1-redirected killing; no activity in MSLN-negative controls.

      **Translational Models (in flight / planned)**

      - Emory/Winship partnerships for PDAC biospecimens, PDXs.
      - Custom transgenic human ApoL1 x human mesothelin mouse models enabling exposure/efficacy and safety studies in a disease-relevant background.

      **Near-Term Milestones**

      - Complete NSG mouse efficacy studies and ApoL1 / human mesothelin transgenic mouse evaluations.
      - Complete transgenic model characterization and pilot tox studies/efficacy studies.
