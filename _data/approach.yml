intro: "Annate Bitherapeutics is advancing a cutting-edge bispecific antibody platform that leverages the natural power of the human innate immune system. Our technology precisely redirects ApoL1, a potent component of the innate immune complex, to cancer cells—turning a natural defense mechanism into a targeted therapeutic weapon. By guiding ApoL1 directly into tumors, our approach achieves highly selective, immune-cell–independent cancer cell destruction."
points:
  - "Engages ApoL1, a native cytolytic protein circulating in the bloodstream."
  - "Targets cancer-specific markers, delivering ApoL1 directly to tumor cells."
  - "Drives intracellular accumulation of ApoL1, leading to potent and localized tumor cell death."
